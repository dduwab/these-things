A simple ReactJS studio environment

This project is a learning exercise. I'm a software developer with 30ish years experience who has never used git or ReactJS before. (okay, I've used git before, but just for some downloads).

This is a single page app with a row along the top, a column along the left side, and a main central area as a work space. And as I typed that I realized that the row and column shouldn't be locked left and top respectively.

Tabs across top - completely independent of whatever the left-side tabs do.  
Tabs along the side pop open drawers containing things like options and settings.

This project will be a shell for which anyone can plug any functionality they want.

Although I've been an OOP developer all my life I'm going to use functional programming as much as possible.
